# WordMaster Web-App Journey
## Day 1 (06/06/2025)
Today marks the first day of building a vocabulary learning app that allows users to add new words they encounter while surfing on browser and learn it effectively using spaced repetition algorithm.
I will document my three weeks journey of building the app all by myself without relying on copy pasting a code or just vibecoding it without understanding what it is doing. It might not be the most efficient way to build in now a days but I am challenging myself to learn building without relying on AI and not understanding it. Once I understand the process, I can accelerate my progress for other projects by vibecoding the boilerplate. 
## MY WHY 
To be able to build things without relying on AI for the actual coding. I will still use it for finding the best resources or explaining a concept but I will not copy paste anycode that is given to me by the AI. The Goal is to build something functional, it doesn't have to be attractive at first. There is no progress if I am trying to perfect it from the beginning. I will build the "ugly" version of the MVP then iterate to make it better.

Today's deliverable were
- Initialize the project with github repo
- Create a firebase project with authentication set up
- Created Firestore collection to verify the credentials
  
## Day 2(07/06/2025)
Today is my second day 21 day web app building challenge. Today I have accomplished the following tasks
- Created a comprehensive API documentation with appropriate endpoints
- Initialized firebase collections 
  
Tomorrow I will start implementing the api endpoints starting with user authentication

## Day 3 (08/06/2025)
Today I have started the implementation of the endpoints
Deliverables
- Auth endpoints(register,login, logout, user info) implementation
- Tested the routes using postman
- Created Pydantic user models for robust validation
- Created a config file for the whole project configurations
- Refactored main.py to increase the robustness
  
That is the end of day 3. Today I have accomplished a great thing and Tomorrow will be even greater.

## Day 4 (09/06/2025)
Today I started working a bit late and made some other compromises but it will not be repeated
Deliverables
- Implemented Dictionary lookup functionality
- Implemented word management api endpoints
- Refactored some modules
  
It was a success but I will try to finish my work before evening for later time and stop sleeping during day time.


## Day 5 (10/06/2025)
Today was a big day. I worked on the progress and quiz system
Deliverables
- Smart Learning - Words appear for review at optimal intervals
- Adaptive Quizzes - Generated based on what users need to practice
- Progress Analytics - Users can see their learning journey
- Multiple Quiz Types - MCQ, fill-in-blank, word-to-definition
- Performance Tracking - Accuracy, streaks, improvements

I used a little bit more than needed AI but this results due to working so late and wanting to finish early. I have to arrange my sleep schedule that is key.
