# WordMaster Web-App Journey
## Day 1 (06/06/2025)
Today marks the first day of building a vocabulary learning app that allows users to add new words they encounter while surfing on browser and learn it effectively using spaced repetition algorithm.
I will document my three weeks journey of building the app all by myself without relying on copy pasting a code or just vibecoding it without understanding what it is doing. It might not be the most efficient way to build in now a days but I am challenging myself to learn building without relying on AI and not understanding it. Once I understand the process, I can accelerate my progress for other projects by vibecoding the boilerplate. 
## MY WHY 
To be able to build things without relying on AI for the actual coding. I will still use it for finding the best resources or explaining a concept but I will not copy paste anycode that is given to me by the AI. The Goal is to build something functional, it doesn't have to be attractive at first. There is no progress if I am trying to perfect it from the beginning. I will build the "ugly" version of the MVP then iterate to make it better.

Today's deliverable were
- Initialize the project with github repo
- Create a firebase project with authentication set up
- Created Firestore collection to verify the credentials
